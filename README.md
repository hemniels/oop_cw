uploaded my coursework for Object Oriented Programming class.
Includes 2 Android projects. Every program is written in Java.
Some need additional class files (in/out.class) to compile.

The 2 Projects include:
1. A simple calculator App for basic arithmetic functions.
2. An App to navigate (in NSWE directions) an Agent through a 2D spaced Maze to collect trophies.
Android projects are standalone and can be important into w/e IDE you're using.

Thanks.
